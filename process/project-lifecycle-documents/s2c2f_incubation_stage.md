## Project incubation application for Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F)

It is the shared view of the S2C2F Technical Steering Committee that S2C2F meets the requirements of an **Incubation** project within the OpenSSF.

## Lifecycle History of S2C2F within OpenSSF

The S2C2F was first contributed to OpenSSF in August 2022. It joined OpenSSF as a SIG within the Supply Chain Integrity WG. Upon contribution, a detailed IP policy and license review was performed. On Feb 1, 2024, the S2C2F graduated from a SIG to a Project with the adoption of a Technical Charter.

### Mission of the project

The mission of the Secure Supply Chain Consumption Framework (S2C2F) project is to empower any software development team or organization across the industry with a clear framework to securely consume Open Source Software (OSS) dependencies into the developer's workflow to aid in mitigating risk against threats to OSS supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities. 

### Project adoption

* "Most granular, and least ambiguous, is S2C2F, which provides real life examples. Love the maturity levels, so they can establish a baseline and build on it over time. S2C2F has so far been one of the more useful frameworks that they can adopt at scale everywhere. It helps describe things in a consistent way to non-technical folks, and has proven extremely useful. The existence of S2C2F has made what would have been a headache for my role, much simpler.‚Äù -Tom Bedford, Bloomberg
* "Dell is using the S2C2F to build their plans to secure their open source supply chain." -Sarah Evans, Dell
* CloudSmith is using the S2C2F to influence their product roadmap so that customers of CloudSmith meet S2C2F requirements just by using their product.
* NSA Enduring Security Framework (ESF) published the Recommended Practices for Managing Open-Source Software and Software Bill of Materials, which references the S2C2F as an industry framework that aligns with their recommendations.
* Book entitled [Software Transparency: Supply Chain Security in an Era of a Software-Driven Society](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Software+Transparency%3A+Supply+Chain+Security+in+an+Era+of+a+Software+Driven+Society-p-9781394158492) dedicates an entire chapter to S2C2F and its role to securing the supply chain.
