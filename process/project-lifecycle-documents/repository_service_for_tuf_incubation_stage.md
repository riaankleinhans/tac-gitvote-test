### Mission of the project
The Repository Service for TUF's mission is to make it easier for repositories to integrate the features of [The Update Framework (TUF)] without requiring TUF expertise or deep changes to the repository service implementation.

The project provides repository signing functionality with a simple REST API for integration into any repository offering. The system's architecture enables scalability for high-traffic repositories.

The project was born out of experience developing changes for Warehouse (PyPI) to deliver [PEP 458] and, for the initial roadmap, focuses on providing PEP 458-like repository signing functionality. In future, the Repository Service for TUF will develop to support other TUF architecture patterns including [PEP 480]-like developer signing and more.
