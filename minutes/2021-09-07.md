    * David: I’ll try to get an LF editor to review, but we can do that in parallel.
* Elections to come
    * There’s a charter update to switch to membership dues. This will provide funding to the OpenSSF.
    * Kay: When we formed the OpenSSF, there were a lot of financial uncertainties due to the pandemic, so we formed it without requiring member dues. Now that we’ve had a year & things are clearer, we’re switching to requiring member dues. Will have premier membership levels. This also implies changes to the governing board; each premier membership gives a seat on the governing board (GB), the rest of the members vote for reps on the GB (1 rep / 10 member companies, up to 3 reps). We expect some continuity, but there will be some changes. Intend for this complete November.
    * TAC elections: GB is supposed to officially ratify the TAC election process, need to do that. We could do that with the current GB, or wait for the new GB.
    * TAC members were open to waiting for the new GB.
