    * Request For Input: “It is a pain to try and keep all these diagrams up to date, it would help to get some input so we can select a couple to start focusing on for now”
    * 
* (needs to start after :30 past) [Kairo / Zach / Joshua] New Sandbox Project request: [ossf/tac#137](https://github.com/ossf/tac/pull/137): contribute “RSTUF” (sponsored by Securing Software Repos WG)s
    * Containers are provided to simplify deployment.
    * E.g., a Python container that can run on bare metal (no Kubernetes).
    * The current documents focus on running on containers, but the system doesn’t require containers.
    * It does depend on Python-TUF.
    * Looking at the issues, doesn’t seem to be a major controversy.
    * TAC: We continue to have quorum, so we can vote right now.
    * Jacques: There was a great presentation about RSTUF at Securing Repos WG
        * [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ6k3QR95J4)
        * [Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-f6m442MHg9hktrbcp-4sM9GbZC3HLTpZPpxMXjMCp4/edit#heading=h.39jar4rgsvu9)
        * [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Eu580ojkdMUEIY1Amh4IJNRga7WxkxaZoO5nyLrgsHw/edit#slide=id.p1)
    * The plan is to put RSTUF within the Securing Repos WG, the WG has already accepted it.
    * 6 approved, one abstain.
    * There seems to be confusing about how projects are accepted. Need to open an issue to clarify - the written requirements say “tell the TAC”, but in practice, if it’s to be part of WG, the WG agrees, and it’s in-scope of the WG, then the TAC is notified for issues but unless the TAC objects it’s in the OpenSSF. The TAC *must* vote to accept a project as a top-level project directly under the TAC.
