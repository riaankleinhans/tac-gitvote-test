## Agenda:

* Election Process Update
    * Election Officials (must be eligible to vote & not running for a position): Ryan Haning (Microsoft), David A. Wheeler (LF), Stephen Chin (JFrog)
    * Announce self nomination of candidates
    * Complication: The charter says GB elects 4, community elects 3. Ryan looked at old notes & believe _intent_ was GB elects 3, community elects 4. Brian B. will research, talk with GB, get back to TAC about this.
        * BB response: indeed, GB agreed with 3, community elects 4.
    * Jory & Jenn to prepare election forms & email the group; election officials to help answer questions of eligibility/participation, Staff to answer questions of election process
* Pyrsia, a Decentralized Package Network. (Stephen Chin, JFrog). Draft proposal here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gg6cAWXKiG--ioZ20xMGV5fBkSNCbJ92KuKukHkmQeg/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gg6cAWXKiG--ioZ20xMGV5fBkSNCbJ92KuKukHkmQeg/edit)
* [Component Detection](https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection) - (Jamie Magee, Microsoft) \
build-time scanning tool to detect dependencies in a codebase
    * MIT license
    * Many transitive dependencies detected, but there are some gaps, e.g., gradle
        * Everything with a checkmark in graph creation support transitive dependencies: [https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection/#feature-overview](https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection/#feature-overview)
    * Future plans?
        * Laura MacLeod: Adding more detectors. We’ve been focusing more on Microsoft ecosystems. Currently working to add Python poetry (already support pip)
        * Just wanted to see “how we could help”
    * Do you capture hashes?
        * Rely on package manager information. Go & pip do support commit-level references, so in those cases we’ll pick it up & share it on.
    * See “An Analysis of the SSC Landscape” by Aeva Black, [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KT5QPCgVx_8UFIKv8-0k9GYjfcL3uvHmK4COOEGq_UQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KT5QPCgVx_8UFIKv8-0k9GYjfcL3uvHmK4COOEGq_UQ)
* FYI: Great MFA Distribution Project is actively working to contact projects for sending MFA tokens
