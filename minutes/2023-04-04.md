    * Seeing adopters popping up at distance from OpenSSF itself
    * FRSCA 
        * Trying to find more maintainers/contributors. 
        * Hard to see what downstream customers want: (1) example/ref arch? (2) Or for something turnkey they can migrate to? Less appetite for second usage than expected. 
        * Looking now how to see what FRSCA can do for existing / incumbent build systems
    * S2C2F
        * Working through initial set of issues
        * Some training material has been developed, ~90% complete course. 
        * Talk accepted for RSA conf
    * Asks of TAC:
        * FRSCA: use cases/evangelization of project? Alignment with Sterling Toolchain concepts? Help bringing new contributors 
* **[jbly]** OpenSSF Day PR & Project/WG monthly feature on OpenSSF blog
    * OpenSSF Day on May 10 at OSS NA
        * Press Release scheduled for that day
        * Please send along announcements to potentially include in the Press Kit
    * Blog series starting tomorrow, April 5
        * Feature a project or WG with recent accomplishments and CFP
        * Perhaps follow a rotation similar to the TAC updates 
* [CRob] (inform) - BEST WG adopted Memory Safety SIG under our umbrella to help drive Stream 04 from the Mobilization Plan
* [brian/bob] TAC expansion proposal
    * Brian Behlendorf: will lay proposal before GB to add 2 members (taking to 9), adding 2 appointed this year, changing to 1 appt 1 elected for next year.
    * Bob Callaway: not sure if growing to 9 is necessary, perhaps need more staff support and engagement from TAC
    * Jacques Chester: keen to see end user representation on TAC, as end users have distinct problems, incentives and perspectives from vendors and producers
    * David Edelsohn: should there be TAC subcommittees to subdivide tasks?
* [Jonathan Leitschuh] - [Proposal: Open Source Security Foundation Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W2Xfw9i5pSA-0XbIw3a4kcW2o4PByxDbjcnWe9mlQwA/edit#heading=h.3fukntovbf8q)
    * Note: this proposal would only apply to vulnerabilities that are disclosed by the OpenSSF, not inbound to OpenSSF projects
    * This is scoped to manual reporting - automated mass reporting would be a separate policy, which is still being worked.
    * If we discover it’s being actively exploited after the private reporting, the shorter timeframe begins. In practice, we’re unlikely to use the short timeframe often; proprietary vendors have the executables & often have information to alert them about it, while we typically only see source code repositories & don’t have a lot of information on active exploitation.
    * LF Legal is currently reviewing this document, hopefully we’ll hear from them by next TAC meeting & have any tweaks from them. If so, we’d like the TAC to vote on this policy in the next TAC meeting.
    * Please review by tomorrow 11am ET.
    * Review only at today’s meeting, for vote offline OR at next TAC meeting
    * We could also vote offline, we don’t have to wait for the next synchronous meeting
