    * There’s a meeting at the White House this Wednesday, CEOs from various sectors (about 35), we know tech is there. Following that, there will be a panel discussion (probably by sector). NIST & White House are interested in the tech sector coming together to create standards re: cybersecurity. Refer to SLSA. Also [SCIM](https://github.com/microsoft/scim) (supply chain integrity model) that Microsoft is spearheading, getting ready to move into OpenSSF ~September, intend it to be an open source project.
