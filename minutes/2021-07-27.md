## Agenda

* OSTIF budget vote - [OSTIF Open Source MAP 2021 OpenSSF - Modified for Proposed Grant - Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlLoohg8ZSK6Lad538Nq3FqC0ouPRcACOGdea_NqQ6Y/edit#heading=h.5fa2j8dq0uqa)

        An updated proposal was created to demonstrate what OSTIF will do with $60,000. In summary, OSTIF proposes a complete end-to-end review of **Symfony**. The reasoning is as follows:

* Symfony is used in thousands of applications including nearly all of the popular PHP frameworks. It controls security-critical functions such as permissions and authentication, manages databases, and in many cases handles untrusted file uploads.
* Symfony comes in at #8 on the OpenSSF Criticality Score
* Lastly,[ recent CVEs show classes of bugs that can be minimized with better testing](https://www.cvedetails.com/product/22402/Sensiolabs-Symfony.html?vendor_id=11981), suggesting that there may be incomplete testing that can be improved upon.
* TAC voted and APPROVED, Ryan will send proposal to GB (GB meets next week).
* Supply Chain Security & the EO (Kay Williams) -[EO, SBOM and Supply Chain Integrity.pptx - Google Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HYUg8tq65ZQWqq6em0QyCymDnala7vjg/view?usp=sharing)
