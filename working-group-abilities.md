# Working Group Abilities

Established working groups in the OpenSSF are given broad latitude to accomplish their goals.
The TAC aims to only require formal approval in limited cases.
This document outlines some of the explicitly permitted activities and resources made
available to working groups.


As per the OpenSSF [charter/FAQ](https://openssf.org/#faq), the TAC is not directly in charge
of sub initiatives.
These are intended to run themselves, and are expected to make most decisions without needing
to ask the TAC for permission.
With this in mind, this document is not exhaustive and will grow over time - it is intended to
outline the processes for some common requests and resources.

When in doubt, reach out to the TAC with any questions!

## Repositories

We expect that working groups will need to create repositories for code, tools, and other projects.
These should be created in the [ossf](github.com/ossf) organization where possible to simplify
management.

Working groups can also request new organizations where necessary - reach out to the TAC for
logistics.


If any of these projects grow large enough, they can be "spun-off" into separate working groups by
the TAC.
As a general rule-of-thumb, if a sub-project requires its own standing meeting, it might be time to
spin-it-off.

## Papers

As the working groups are intended to be the subject matter experts in their domains,
they should author papers for release through the OpenSSF without review or approval from the TAC.
However, the TAC does ask that drafts be shared as early as possible (hopefully >7 days) for
feedback and awareness.
Drafts can be shared by sending email to openssf-tac@lists.openssf.org.

Once completed, working groups should work with the Governing Board to communicate, promote, and
market the published papers in accordance with the general OpenSSF communication strategy.

All papers should still follow open source best practices including transparency in development and
avoiding vendor bias.

## Technical Infrastructure

Working groups are free to use whatever resources they can find, or to solicit help from member
organizations, or to request funding from the OpenSSF Governing Board, through the TAC.

The TAC asks that working groups keep them informed of what infrastructure they are using for
awareness as we begin the process of collecting formal resources.
