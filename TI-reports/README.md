# Technical Initiative (TI) Updates
TI updates are:
- used by the TAC to determine the health of a TI, including whether it should change state
- provided to the Governing Board on a monthly basis in the TAC Update
- used to highlight interesting updates to the Governing Board about the TIs
- used to share interesting information with member companies by both the staff and TAC members
- suggested as a point of reference for newcomers to determine if a TI would be worth joining based on information like the contributor diversity, as well as, the type of feature work that is ongoing within the TI
