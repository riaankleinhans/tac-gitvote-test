# 2024 Q3 DEI WG Update

## Overview

The DEI WG continues our mission to increase representation and strengthen
the overall effectiveness of the cybersecurity workforce. Although the WG
currently sees very low attendance we've made progress in three areas:

* Improved coverage and extended WG reach by appointing additional WG Co-Chairs.
* Increased outreach through panel discussions and community office hours.
* Development of a Q3 roadmap.

### Recent Updates 

More details on our recent activities:

* **Appointment of WG Co-Chairs**: To support Jay White as the founding WG
Chair, Yesenia Yser and Marcela Melara volunteered to join as Co-Chairs. This
change has enabled the WG to more rapidly address WG activities and needs.

* **DEI Panel Discussion**: The WG held a [panel discussion] at SOSS
Community Day NA '24 on the importance of DEI in OSS and Security communities,
including a call to action to join the WG. The panel was well-attended and
well-received at the event. The panelists also published an
[OpenSSF blog post] promoting the panel discussion and the DEI WG.

* **Community Office Hours**: Towards the WG's mission of lowering
barriers to entry and engaging underrepresented communities in OSS and
cybersecurity, the WG is planning [monthly Community Office Hours] in which
the WG hosts speakers to discuss a specific topic of interest specifically
to underrepresented groups.

* **WG Roadmap**: As the WG gains momentum, the WG Co-Chairs have focused
on putting together a short-term roadmap for Q3 2024.

### Purpose

The main objective of our recent activities has been to raise awareness about
the DEI WG, improve attendance and begin outreach to engage with and attract
folks in underrepresented groups to participate in the WG and OpenSSF at large.

### Current Status

Our recent activities focusing on WG direction and outreach are mutually
reinforcing, i.e., both are needed in order to grow the WG as well as achieve
our mission.

While our attendance is still quite low at WG meetings, we are beginning to see
the impact of our activities through a growing number of new community members
on Slack and in meetings.

Status of current activities:

* **Community Office Hours**: The first Community Office Hours are planned for
July 25 at 12pm ET on the topic of Getting Started in OSS and Cybersecurity.
We have a tentative monthly schedule for the remainder of Q3 with several other
topic ideas on our list.

* **WG Roadmap**: Our primary focus for Q3 is to get the Community Office
Hours organized, and into a regular cadence. We are also planning on introducing
a monthly Tip of the Month series of social media posts starting in August, in
which we highlight a specific WG community member and a career or tech tip they
would like to share with the OpenSSF community and beyond.

### Up Next

In the coming months, our focus will continue to be on growing the WG community
through improved attendance numbers at meetings and Community Office Hours. We
also intend to develop a longer term WG roadmap for EOY 2024 based on the
successes and lessons learned in Q3.

We also plan to extend our outreach through social media posts, as well as
targeted engagements with other LF communities (e.g., LF ABIDE proposal) and
professional organizations (e.g., Black Girls Code, WiCys).

### Questions/Issues for the TAC

Several TAC members are either Co-Chairs or regular attendees of the DEI WG.

The biggest challenge we continue to face is a lack of visibility and momentum.
We have two main current asks for the rest of the TAC:

1) Please help amplify the work that the DEI WG is doing in your networks.
2) Please refer colleagues, contacts or mentees to the DEI WG, especially if they
identify/belong to an underrepresented group in tech (gender, race/ethnic,
disability, educational background, geographic region etc.). We would love to
have them join the community and higlight their work/contributions through our
activities.
